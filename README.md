## Inspiration
Speech impaired people use hand signs and gestures to communicate. Normal people face difficulty in understanding their language.As a result, **HelpForYou** is a system which recognizes the different signs, gestures and conveys the information to the normal people. It bridges the gap between physically challenged people and
normal people.
